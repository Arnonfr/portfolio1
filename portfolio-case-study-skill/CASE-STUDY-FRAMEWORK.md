[List of disciplines as tags]
- Discipline 1
- Discipline 2
- Discipline 3

## [One-sentence value proposition that captures the essence]

[Optional: Brief client description or context setter]
```

**Example (UWGLA):**

### 4. Design Solution Section Content Template

Each major deliverable gets its own section with:

```markdown
# 0[N] [Deliverable Name - e.g., Branding]

[1-2 paragraph explanation of the approach and philosophy]

[Visual examples with captions]

[Detailed breakdown with sub-sections if needed]
```

**Example Pattern (UWGLA Branding):**
```
# 01 Branding

United Way of Greater Los Angeles is a legacy philanthropy with generations 
of built trust and impactful work. The new brand honors that legacy, while 
uplifting the radical, empowering nature of their work, and the humanity of 
the communities they work with. The brand is empowering and bold, with the 
flexibility to adopt a knowledgable and professional tone when appropriate.

[Typography & Colors visual]

Typography sets the tone in this ecosystem, flexing between bold or refined, 
energetic or professional, gutsy or wise. We enhanced UWGLA's original brand 
colors with deeper, more vibrant hues, grounded in the energy of Los Angeles.

[Graphics visual]

Graphic elements are pulled from the United Way logo itself and are used to 
integrate motion and meaning into the identity.
```

### Key Takeaways

• Challenge
- [Challenge 1]
- [Challenge 2]
- [Challenge 3]

- [Lesson 3]
```

**Example (Knowlex):**
```
• Challenge
- To find the right angle together with an interesting story to tell when 
  dealing with a widely explored industry such as EDtech
- To make a huge effort in prioritisation when creating an MVP
- To think about detailed aspects users might need when designing an 
  application form

• Lesson learned
- The effort of keeping it simple can make a difference in the final outcome
- The importance of a well-designed UI library, that is built up using 
  components, variants and frames
- Designing in a consistent way can truly help speed up the whole process
```

## 🎯 Content Principles (Extracted from Analysis)

### 1. **Specificity Over Vagueness**
❌ "We created a modern, clean design"
✅ "Typography sets the tone in this ecosystem, flexing between bold or refined, energetic or professional, gutsy or wise"

### 2. **Show Process, Not Just Output**
Include: Research → Strategy → Design → Testing → Iteration → Outcome

### 3. **Use Visuals to Tell the Story**
- Every section has relevant visuals
- Visuals are annotated or captioned
- Before/after comparisons for iterations
- Process diagrams (user flows, sitemaps)

### 4. **Numbered Sections for Navigation**
Both examples use section numbers:
- "01 Branding", "02 Website", "03 Motion", "04 Editorial"
- Helps readers jump to sections
- Creates visual rhythm

### 5. **Balance Technical and Human Language**
- Technical: "I've built a sitemap considering primary, secondary and tertiary navigation"
- Human: "The brand is empowering and bold, with the flexibility to adopt a knowledgable and professional tone"

### 6. **Always Include Your Thinking**
Not just "what" but "why":
- "We enhanced UWGLA's original brand colors with deeper, more vibrant hues, grounded in the energy of Los Angeles"
- "After a first draft of P1 features, I've realised I had to reduce the effort to just as enough features as MVP needed"

---

## 🎨 Visual Content Patterns

### 1. **Hero Visuals**
- Large, full-width visual
- Often video/animation showing final product in action
- Sets the tone immediately

### 2. **Section Dividers**
- Clear visual breaks between major sections
- Often with section numbers and icons/graphics
- Creates breathing room

### 3. **Process Diagrams**
Common types:
- Competitive analysis matrix
- Affinity mapping boards
- User flows (with legend)
- Task flows (with decision points)
- Sitemaps/Information architecture
- Wireframe progressions (sketches → lo-fi → hi-fi)

### 4. **Before/After Comparisons**
- Side-by-side layouts
- "AI Slop" vs "Human Signature" style
- Iterations from user testing

### 5. **Component/System Showcases**
- UI libraries with typography, colors, components
- Brand guidelines spreads
- Design system documentation

### 6. **Mockup Presentations**
- Devices (phone, laptop, billboard)
- In-context mockups (magazine, poster, social media)
- Grid layouts showing variety

---

## 📐 Layout Patterns

### Pattern A: Vertical Scroll Story (UWGLA Style)
```
[Full-width hero video]
[Overview paragraph]
[Section navigation menu]
[Section 01: Full-width title + content + visuals]
[Section 02: Full-width title + content + visuals]
[Section 03: Full-width title + content + visuals]
[Project navigation: ← Previous | Home | Next →]
```

**Characteristics:**
- Long scrolling page
- Each section is self-contained
- Heavy on full-width visuals
- Minimal text, maximum visual impact

### Pattern B: Structured Report (Knowlex Style)
```
[Hero image]
[Quick navigation to sections]

  ├─ Subsection: Competitive Analysis
  ├─ Subsection: User Interviews
  └─ Subsection: Personas
[Section 02: UX Design]
  ├─ Subsection: Prioritization
  ├─ Subsection: Information Architecture
  └─ Subsection: User Flows
[Section 03: UI Design]
[Section 04: Usability Test]

[CTA: Test Prototype]
```

**Characteristics:**
- Clear hierarchical structure
- Each section expands with subsections
- "Click to enlarge" for detailed visuals
- More text-heavy, process-focused

---

## ✍️ Writing Style Guidelines

### Tone Analysis

**UWGLA (Design Studio Style):**
- Confident and declarative
- Focus on impact and human outcomes
- Short, punchy sentences
- Emotionally resonant language
- Example: "The brand is empowering and bold"

**Knowlex (UX Case Study Style):**
- Methodical and process-oriented
- Focus on decisions and rationale
- Bullet points for clarity
- Technical precision
- Example: "I've immediately identified my two user flows"

### Voice Patterns

**Use active voice:**
- ✅ "We enhanced UWGLA's original brand colors"
- ❌ "UWGLA's original brand colors were enhanced"

**Use first person (especially UX):**
- ✅ "I've created a loading animation"
- ❌ "A loading animation was created"

**Be specific:**
- ✅ "Five people were interviewed: 2 Teacher/Student users; 2 Student users; 1 Not really a user"
- ❌ "Several users were interviewed"

**Show constraints:**
- ✅ "However this was MVP, so I've decided to go for the main ones"
- Shows prioritization thinking

---

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### Section Markers
Both case studies use visual section markers:

**UWGLA:**
- Arrow icons
- Star icons
- Section numbers (01, 02, 03, 04)

**Knowlex:**
- Jump-to links at top ([UX RESEARCH] | [UX DESIGN] | [UI DESIGN])
- Section headers with clear hierarchy
- "Click to enlarge" for detailed images

### Interactive Elements

**Essential:**
- External prototype links ("View Project Prototype")
- Expandable images
- Video players (auto-play or click-to-play)
- Navigation to next/previous projects

**Optional but effective:**
- Smooth scroll to sections
- Progress indicator
- Animated section reveals
- Hover states on images

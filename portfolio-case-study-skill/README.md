## 🎨 Core Principles

### 1. Show Process, Not Just Output
Don't just show what you made—show **HOW you thought about it** and **WHY you made those decisions**.

### 2. Be Specific
"Reduced cost by 90%" > "Improved efficiency"  
"5 user interviews" > "Conducted research"  
"Changed button color from blue to green because..." > "Optimized design"

### 3. Tell a Story
Problem → Research → Strategy → Design → Testing → Outcome → Reflection

### 4. Be Honest
Share constraints, challenges, what didn't work. It shows maturity and problem-solving.

### 5. Use Visuals
Every section should have relevant images, diagrams, or screenshots. Case studies are visual documents.

## 💡 Pro Tips

### 1. Start with Your Best Work
Don't try to document every project—focus on 3-5 case studies that show your range and depth.

### 2. Tailor to Your Audience
Applying to agencies? Emphasize collaboration and process.  
Applying to startups? Emphasize speed and outcomes.  
Applying to enterprises? Emphasize scale and systems thinking.

### 3. Iterate Your Case Studies
Just like you iterate designs, iterate your case studies. Get feedback and improve them over time.

### 4. Don't Wait for Permission
You don't need your client's permission to document your process (though you do need permission to show their final work). Focus on YOUR thinking, not their brand.

### 5. Use Real Project Names
Even for side projects or spec work, give them real names and context. It makes them feel more credible.

## 🚀 Final Thought

> "A case study is not about showing you did the work.  
   It's about showing you can THINK about the work."

Focus on demonstrating:
- **How you think** about problems
- **How you make decisions** under constraints
- **How you learn** from feedback
- **How you balance** user needs, business goals, and technical feasibility

Your portfolio is your story. Tell it well.

**Now go build something great.** 📐✨

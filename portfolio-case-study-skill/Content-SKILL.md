## What Makes a Great Case Study

Based on analysis of professional portfolios, excellent case studies have:

### ✅ Clear Narrative Arc
**Problem → Process → Solution → Impact**

Every section builds on the previous one. The reader understands WHY decisions were made, not just WHAT was made.

### ✅ Specific Details
- Actual numbers: "reduced cost by 90%", "5 user interviews"
- Named methodologies: "Competitive analysis", "A/B testing"
- Quoted findings: Direct user feedback
- Timelines: "2-week sprint", "6-month project"

### ✅ Visual Hierarchy
- Easy to scan
- Important content stands out
- Logical flow from section to section
- Generous white space

### ✅ Process Transparency
Show your thinking:
- Research methods and findings
- Design iterations and why
- Technical decisions and trade-offs
- Challenges and how you solved them

### ✅ Honest Reflection
- Constraints you worked within
- Challenges you faced
- What you learned
- What you'd do differently

### ✅ Tangible Outcomes
- What actually launched
- User/client feedback
- Measurable results
- Your personal growth

## Quick Decision Tree

**What type of case study should I create?**

```
Is your project primarily about...

└─ User research and product design?
   → Use Template 1: UX/Product Design
   → Focus on: Research → Strategy → Design → Testing
   → Example: Knowlex case study

└─ Visual identity and brand expression?
   → Use Template 2: Branding/Visual Design
   → Focus on: Concept → Identity → Applications → Impact
   → Example: UWGLA case study

└─ Technical implementation and engineering?
   → Use Template 3: Development/Technical
   → Focus on: Problem → Architecture → Implementation → Performance
   → Add your own example

└─ A side project or shorter work?
   → Use Template 4: Quick Case Study
   → Focus on: Problem → Solution → Outcome (concise)
   → Include 2-4 key visuals

└─ Combination of the above?
   → Combine templates
   → Prioritize what's most interesting about your project
   → Lead with your strongest work
```

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

### ❌ Mistake 1: Only Showing Final Designs
**Problem:** Readers can't see your thinking or process  
**Fix:** Include research, wireframes, iterations, and rationale

### ❌ Mistake 2: Vague Descriptions
**Problem:** "We improved the user experience"  
**Fix:** "We reduced checkout time from 3 minutes to 45 seconds by removing 2 steps"

### ❌ Mistake 3: Too Much Text
**Problem:** Walls of text that readers skip  
**Fix:** Use visuals to tell the story, text to explain key decisions

### ❌ Mistake 4: No Context
**Problem:** Jumping straight to solutions without explaining the problem  
**Fix:** Always start with WHY this project mattered

### ❌ Mistake 5: Taking All Credit
**Problem:** Claiming sole ownership of team work  
**Fix:** Be clear about your role and give credit to collaborators

### ❌ Mistake 6: Hiding Constraints
**Problem:** Making it seem like everything went perfectly  
**Fix:** Share challenges and how you adapted - it shows problem-solving

### ❌ Mistake 7: Generic Stock Content
**Problem:** Using placeholder images or lorem ipsum  
**Fix:** Only show real project content

### ❌ Mistake 8: No Outcomes
**Problem:** Case study ends after "we launched"  
**Fix:** Share what happened after - feedback, metrics, learnings

## Example 1: Strong Hero Section

### From: UWGLA (Josie Grimmett)

```
# 01 United Way of Greater Los Angeles

Website Design | Branding | Interaction Design | Animation | 
Social Design | Editorial Design

## Supporting solutions to inequality, advancing economic mobility, 
   and uplifting underserved communities
```

**Why this works:**

✅ **Project number creates portfolio structure** - "01" suggests a curated collection  
✅ **Discipline tags are specific** - Not just "design" but 6 specific areas  
✅ **Value proposition is human-focused** - Talks about impact, not features  
✅ **Tone matches client** - Empowering language for nonprofit work  
✅ **Immediately clear what the project is** - Rebrand for a nonprofit

**Apply this pattern:**
```
# [Number][Your Project Name]

[Specific Discipline 1] | [Specific Discipline 2] | [Specific Discipline 3]

## [One sentence about the impact/value, not the deliverable]
```

## Example 2: Strong Context Setting

### From: Knowlex (Florinda Sgueglia)

```
**Overview**: Knowledge is probably the greatest power of all. 
Affordable education has become possible over the years even thanks 
to technology.

**Role**: UX Researcher, UX/UI designer

**Toolkit**: Figma, Adobe CC, FigJam, Pencil and paper
```

**Why this works:**

✅ **Opens with the problem space** - Sets philosophical context  
✅ **Role is specific** - Not "designer" but exact responsibilities  
✅ **Toolkit is honest** - Includes low-tech tools (pencil and paper)  
✅ **Immediately scannable** - Bold labels make it easy to find info

**What could be stronger:**

⚠️ Could add timeline: "Timeline: 8 weeks"  
⚠️ Could add team context: "Team: Solo project"  
⚠️ Opening is slightly generic - could be more specific to THIS project

**Apply this pattern:**
```
**Overview**: [1-2 sentences about the problem space or opportunity]

**Role**: [Your specific responsibilities]
**Toolkit**: [Actual tools used, high-tech and low-tech]
**Timeline**: [Duration]
**Team**: [Solo / Team size / Collaborators]
```

## Example 3: Excellent Research Framing

### From: Knowlex (Florinda Sgueglia)

```
### Research Goals

We want to investigate how people relate to EDtech platforms, 
so that we understand how users can swap different kinds of 
knowledge through a tech product.
```

**Why this works:**

✅ **Formula: "investigate X so that understand Y"** - Clear cause and effect  
✅ **Specific to the product** - Not generic "understand users"  
✅ **Implies action** - Understanding will lead to design decisions  
✅ **Accessible language** - No jargon

**Compare to weaker versions:**

❌ "Research goal: Understand users"  
❌ "We wanted to learn more about our target audience"  
❌ "Conduct user research to inform design decisions"

**Apply this pattern:**
```
We want to [investigate/understand/explore] [specific aspect], 
so that [we can achieve/design/solve] [specific outcome].
```

## Example 4: Specific Research Findings

### From: Knowlex (Florinda Sgueglia)

```
**Finding the right angle**
In-depth training and soft skills

**Power of community**
The need of social contact

**Timing your freedom**
Studying at your own pace

**Having too much as having nothing**
There's a need to categorise
```

**Why this works:**

✅ **Findings have memorable titles** - Easy to reference later  
✅ **Pairs concept with explanation** - Title + one-line description  
✅ **Balanced specificity** - Not too vague, not too detailed for overview  
✅ **Each finding is actionable** - Implies a design direction

**How these could be even stronger:**

⚠️ Add evidence: "4 out of 5 users mentioned..."  
⚠️ Add quotes: '"I need to connect with other learners" - User 3'  
⚠️ Show priority: Number them by importance

**Apply this pattern:**
```
**[Catchy Finding Title]**
[One-sentence explanation]
[Optional: Evidence or quote]
```

## Example 5: Design Decision Explanation

### From: UWGLA (Josie Grimmett)

```
Typography sets the tone in this ecosystem, flexing between 
bold or refined, energetic or professional, gutsy or wise. 
We enhanced UWGLA's original brand colors with deeper, more 
vibrant hues, grounded in the energy of Los Angeles.
```

**Why this works:**

✅ **Explains the "why"** - Typography is flexible because the brand needs to flex  
✅ **Specific contrasts** - "bold or refined", "energetic or professional"  
✅ **Grounds decision in context** - "energy of Los Angeles"  
✅ **Builds on existing** - "enhanced UWGLA's original brand colors"  
✅ **Poetic but precise** - Evocative language that still communicates clearly

**Compare to weaker versions:**

❌ "We chose typography that works for the brand"  
❌ "Colors were selected to be vibrant and energetic"  
❌ "The typeface reflects the client's values"

**Apply this pattern:**
```
[Design element] [what it does] by [specific qualities/contrasts]. 
We [action taken] [rationale grounded in project context].
```

## Example 6: Iteration Documentation

### From: Knowlex (Florinda Sgueglia)

```
**To improve Checkout experience**, I've differentiated info about 
'Your credit' and 'Value of lesson' in terms of colours. I've also 
added 'Remaining Balance' details
```

**Why this works:**

✅ **States the goal first** - "improve Checkout experience"  
✅ **Lists specific changes** - Color differentiation + added detail  
✅ **Active voice** - "I've differentiated", "I've added"  
✅ **Includes visual** - Before/after screenshots shown

**What's missing:**

⚠️ Could add the problem: "Users were confused about..."  
⚠️ Could add the result: "This increased successful checkouts by X%"

**Full iteration pattern:**
```
**Problem**: [What users struggled with / what testing revealed]
**Change**: [Specific modification made]
**Result**: [Outcome of the change]
[Before/After visual]
```

---

## Example 7: Challenge Framing

### From: Knowlex (Florinda Sgueglia)

```
• Challenge
- To find the right angle together with an interesting story to 
  tell when dealing with a widely explored industry such as EDtech
- To make a huge effort in prioritisation when creating an MVP
- To think about detailed aspects users might need when designing 
  an application form
```

**Why this works:**

✅ **Honest about real challenges** - Not "how to make it perfect"  
✅ **Specific to project type** - MVP prioritization, EDtech competition  
✅ **Shows strategic thinking** - Finding the angle, not just executing  
✅ **Acknowledges constraints** - Working within MVP scope

**How this could be stronger:**

⚠️ Add how challenges were addressed:
```
• Challenge: [Problem]
  Solution: [How I addressed it]
  Learning: [What this taught me]
```

## Example 8: Weak → Strong Comparison

### Weak Version:
```
I designed a new app that helps people learn from each other. 
It has a clean, modern interface with an easy-to-use design. 
Users really liked it.
```

**Problems:**
❌ Vague ("new app", "helps people")  
❌ Buzzwords ("clean", "modern", "easy-to-use")  
❌ No specifics ("users really liked it")  
❌ No process shown  
❌ No challenges mentioned

### Strong Version:
```
Knowlex is a knowledge-exchange platform where users teach skills 
they know to earn credits for learning new skills. After interviewing 
5 users (2 teachers, 2 students, 1 skeptic), I identified that community 
and flexibility were more important than breadth of courses. 

I designed a credit system and two-sided marketplace in Figma, tested 
with 4 users, and iterated based on feedback that the checkout flow 
was confusing. The final prototype increased task completion from 
60% to 85%.
```

**Improvements:**
✅ Specific concept  
✅ Actual research numbers  
✅ Concrete findings  
✅ Named tools  
✅ Iteration based on data  
✅ Quantified outcome

## Example 9: Visual Explanation

### From: UWGLA (Josie Grimmett)

```
Graphic elements are pulled from the United Way logo itself and 
are used to integrate motion and meaning into the identity. Other 
elements are inspired by the visual language of activism, both 
digitally and on-the-ground.
```

**Why this works:**

✅ **Explains source of graphics** - "pulled from the United Way logo"  
✅ **States purpose** - "integrate motion and meaning"  
✅ **Adds contextual inspiration** - "visual language of activism"  
✅ **Connects to brand values** - Activism aligns with nonprofit mission

**Apply to your visuals:**
```
[Visual elements] are [derived from/inspired by] [specific source] 
and [purpose/function]. [Additional context that deepens meaning].
```

## Example 10: Process Transparency

### From: Knowlex (Florinda Sgueglia)

```
After a first draft of P1 features, I've realised I had to reduce 
the effort to just as enough features as MVP needed. In the final 
version I've included basic features such as signup, settings and 
search as well as special ones like become a teacher or credits system
```

**Why this works:**

✅ **Shows the thinking process** - "After... I've realised..."  
✅ **Admits iteration** - Had to reduce scope  
✅ **Explains prioritization** - "just as enough features as MVP needed"  
✅ **Lists specific features** - Not vague about what made the cut

**This is better than:**
❌ "I designed the following features..."  
❌ "The MVP includes basic and advanced features"

---

## Example 11: Section Transition

### From: UWGLA (Josie Grimmett)

```
# 02 website

### expressive & modular

The brand came to life with the redesign of the UWGLA website, 
a 50+ page site full of information, resources, events, and impact. 
After conducting UX discovery, auditing and analysis, we created 
site maps and information architecture that guided our designs. 
The scale of the project and the playfulness of the design called 
for careful balance of modularity and brand expression.
```

**Why this works:**

✅ **Numbered section** - Clear structure  
✅ **Thematic title** - "expressive & modular" sets expectation  
✅ **Context first** - Explains scope (50+ pages)  
✅ **Process mentioned** - UX discovery, auditing, analysis  
✅ **Tension identified** - "balance of modularity and brand expression"

**Pattern for section openings:**
```
# [Number][Section Name]

### [Key Theme/Approach]

[Context: What is this section about?]
[Process: What did you do?]
[Challenge: What tension/constraint existed?]
```

## Red Flags to Avoid

### 🚩 Red Flag 1: Feature List Without Context
```
❌ "The app includes: user profiles, messaging, search, and filters"
✅ "Based on interviews with 5 users who struggled to find relevant 
   content, I prioritized advanced filtering (by topic, level, format) 
   over basic keyword search"
```

### 🚩 Red Flag 2: Process Without Decision
```
❌ "I created wireframes and then moved to high-fidelity mockups"
✅ "After testing paper sketches with 3 users, I moved to digital 
   wireframes to validate the information hierarchy before investing 
   time in visual design"
```

### 🚩 Red Flag 3: Generic Lessons Learned
```
❌ "I learned the importance of user research and iteration"
✅ "I learned to test navigation labels with users before finalizing—
   what I thought was clear ('Resources') confused 4/5 users, leading 
   me to change it to 'Learning Materials'"
```

### 🚩 Red Flag 4: Vague Outcomes
```
❌ "The project was successful and users were happy"
✅ "Post-launch survey (n=47) showed 89% found what they needed in 
   under 2 minutes, compared to 34% with the old site"
```

### 🚩 Red Flag 5: No Voice
```
❌ "Research was conducted and insights were gathered"
✅ "I interviewed 5 teachers and 3 students to understand how they 
   currently exchange knowledge"
```

## Content Writing Tips

### 1. Opening Sentences That Work

**For problem-solving projects:**
- "[Client] needed [solution] to [overcome challenge]."
- "[Number] of users were struggling with [problem]."
- "How do you [achieve goal] when [constraint exists]?"

**For opportunity projects:**
- "[Client] sought to [ambition] through [approach]."
- "What if [innovative idea] could [benefit]?"
- "[Industry] has long [pain point]. We set out to [solution]."

### 2. Explaining Design Decisions

**Formula:** [Choice] + [Reasoning] + [Outcome]

**Example:**
"We chose **Noto Sans** for its excellent multi-language support, ensuring 
consistent readability across Hebrew (RTL) and English (LTR) layouts, which 
reduced layout bugs by 60%."

**Not:**
"We used Noto Sans for typography."

### 3. Describing Challenges

**Formula:** [Constraint] + [Impact] + [How you adapted]

**Example:**
"With a limited budget of ₪500/month, API costs were consuming 23% of resources. 
I reduced costs by 90% by switching to more efficient models and implementing 
aggressive caching."

**Not:**
"Costs were high so I optimized them."

### 4. Showing Research Insights

**Formula:** [Finding] + [Evidence] + [Design implication]

**Example:**
"Users wanted to study at their own pace (4/5 interviews mentioned flexibility). 
This led us to design an asynchronous learning system rather than scheduled 
live classes."

**Not:**
"Research showed users want flexibility."

### 5. Presenting Iterations

**Formula:** [Problem] → [Test result] → [Change made] → [New result]

**Example:**
"Initial signup had a 40% drop-off rate. Testing revealed users were confused 
by the activation flow. Adding a dedicated overlay with validation code input 
increased completion to 85%."

**Not:**
"We improved the signup flow based on feedback."

✅ Show iterations and what you learned

### Don't:
❌ Use vague buzzwords ("innovative", "cutting-edge", "revolutionary")
❌ Only show final designs without process
❌ Claim sole credit for team work
❌ Include every screen (curate the best)
❌ Apologize for limitations (present confidently)
